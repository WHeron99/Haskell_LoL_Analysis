# ECS713U - Group Project
Group 7 - William Heron and Brandon Taylor

## Building and Running Application
In order to build and run this project, you will require a Stack installation.

If stack is installed, you can simply move the project files to their own directory, and within it, 
execute the following in the terminal to compile the project: `stack build`.

Once the project successfully builds, you can execute the project using `stack exec group-project-exe`, or to view
the documentation, use `stack haddock --open` in order to generate the documentation from the source-code and once
generated, it will open in your browser.
